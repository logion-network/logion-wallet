LOGION INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS CLASSIFICATION (LIRC)

Version 1.0
_________________________________________________________

The Logion intellectual property rights classification (hereinafter “LIRC”) aims to set and define the IP rights (as defined below) claimed by the Creator (as defined by the T&Cs applicable to the transaction) and that are granted to the Buyer (as defined by the T&Cs applicable to the transaction), in the subject of the transaction (hereinafter referred to as the “Underlying Asset”).

The LIRC aims at increasing awareness of IP rights in the Underlying Asset and the legal requirement and associated security of an IP rights grant.

The LIRC is a template provided by Logion, by which intermediaries in the transaction - market places, platforms, project NFTs - may set and define the existence and scope of the IP rights, as claimed by the Creator.

In the event that an intermediary (hereinafter referred to as the “Requester”) requests the application of the LIRC, the Requester will be required to precisely provide the information as to the existence and the scope of the IP rights, by providing required data and/or filling out the required fields and settings.  

In relation to the settings selected and the information provided by the Requester, the latter acknowledges and guarantees that they are accurate, true, and sincere;  that the Requester is acting on behalf of the Creator and has been duly authorized to do so, and, therefore has obtained the Creator’s consent to the LIRC and related guidelines.

The Requester may therefore be liable before the Creator and the Buyer.

The declaration made by the Requester does not necessarily imply and/or guarantee that such IP rights effectively exist and specifically that the Underlying Asset is protected under IP and/or author rights and/or copyright law.

The LIRC provides a list of settings and related human-readable definitions that aim to provide accurate information on the scope of IP rights granted with regard to the Underlying Asset,  which will be visible in the Logion certification.

LIRC itself does not substitute the legal requirement of a formal and complete license and/or assignment grant, adapted to the specificities of the transaction and/or Underlying Asset. It contains de minimis the intent and consent of the parties of the transaction in relation to the scope of IP rights granted.

The onus is on the Requester to ensure that any related and complete license and/or assignment grant is in full compliance with the LIRC.

The Requester acknowledges that (s)he is using the LIRC under his/her sole responsibility and should carefully consider all settings and definitions and their consequences.

The Requester also acknowledges that the LIRC may not be construed as legal advice.
